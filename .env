The Blessed Lord then said: This body, O son of Kunti, is called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.

Chapter 13, Verse 5 That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings-especially in the Vedanta-sutra-and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect.e'
